## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or later
- Maven 3.6+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL (or use Docker)

### 1. Infrastructure Setup

Start the required infrastructure services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres pgadmin kafka zipkin keycloak mail-dev
```

This will start:
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- pgAdmin on port 5050
- Apache Kafka on port 9092
- Zipkin on port 9411
- Keycloak on port 9098
- MailDev on port 1080

### 2. Database Setup

Create the required databases in PostgreSQL:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE customer;
CREATE DATABASE product;
CREATE DATABASE "order";
CREATE DATABASE notification;
```

### 3. Service Startup Order

Start the services in the following order:

**1. Config Server**
```bash
cd config-server
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**2. Discovery Service**
```bash
cd discovery
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**3. API Gateway**
```bash
cd gateway
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**4. Core Services** (can be started in parallel)
```bash
# Customer Service
cd customer
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Product Service
cd product
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Order Service
cd order
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Payment Service
cd payment
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Notification Service
cd notification
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

## üì° API Endpoints

GET    /api/v1/customers          - Get all customers
GET    /api/v1/customers/{id}     - Get customer by ID
DELETE /api/v1/customers/{id}     - Delete customer
GET    /api/v1/customers/exists/{id} - Check if customer exists
```

## üîß Configuration

### Service Ports
- Config Server: 8888
- Discovery Service: 8761
- API Gateway: 8222
- Customer Service: 8090
- Product Service: 8050
- Order Service: 8070
- Payment Service: 8060
- Notification Service: 8040

### Database Configuration
Each service connects to PostgreSQL with the following pattern:
- URL: `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/{service_name}`
- Username: `postgres`
- Password: `safwene17`

### Kafka Topics
- `order-topic` - Order confirmations
- `payment-topic` - Payment confirmations

## üìß Email Templates

The notification service includes HTML email templates:
- **Order Confirmation** - Detailed order summary with products
- **Payment Confirmation** - Payment success notification

Templates are located in `notification/src/main/resources/templates/`

## üê≥ Docker Support

The project includes a comprehensive Docker Compose configuration for all infrastructure services:

```bash
# Start all infrastructure
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

## üìä Monitoring & Tracing

- **Eureka Dashboard**: http://localhost:8761
- **Zipkin Tracing**: http://localhost:9411
- **Keycloak Admin**: http://localhost:9098 (admin/admin)
- **MailDev**: http://localhost:1080
- **pgAdmin**: http://localhost:5050

## üîê Security

The platform implements OAuth2 with JWT tokens:
- Keycloak provides authentication services
- API Gateway handles authorization
- Services are secured with Spring Security
- JWT tokens are validated at the gateway level

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Development

### Building All Services
```bash
# Build all services
find . -name "pom.xml" -execdir mvn clean compile \;

# Run tests
find . -name "pom.xml" -execdir mvn test \;
```

### Service Communication
Services communicate using:
- **Synchronous**: OpenFeign clients for direct service calls
- **Asynchronous**: Kafka messages for event-driven communication

## üìù Sample Data

The product service includes Flyway migrations with sample data:
- 5 product categories (Keyboards, Monitors, Screens, Mice, Accessories)
- 25 sample products with realistic data
- Proper relationships and constraints
